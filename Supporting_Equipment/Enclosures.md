# Enclosures

## ROACH Enclosures

There are a number of options for enclosures that can be used to house a
ROACH/iADC combination. Any ATX enclosure can be modified, provided it
has enough space for the iADC's in front of the board. This normally
entails removing the mounting hardware for the drive bays and any
mounting posts that remain after that process.

The I/O on the back of the ROACH board is placed in the ATX I/O space,
so a custom I/O plate would be required.

The ROACH board does not fit into a 1U ATX case, due to the IO area. A
1.3U case is recommended.

Cooling air should be supplied. This typically is sucked in from the
front and expelled to the back, but there is no fundamental reason not
to change this if required.

Most people so far have used the [iSTAR D107](http://www.istarusa.com/rackmount_chassis/dstorm/1u/d-107.aspx)
case.

## iBOB Enclosures

The iBOBs can be mounted in a modified compact-PCI chassis. You will
need to strip out the backplane and design a custom power supply
solution. Cooling often needs to be beefed-up too.

## BEE2 Enclosures

The BEE2 uses a custom chassis. Check the [BEE2 docs](../FPGA_Hosts/BEE2/README.md).
