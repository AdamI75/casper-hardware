very first power on tests

using the arbitrarily selected Vin 78.3 VDC :

Vout max = 77.6 VDC

after 1 360 deg clockwise turn of the fine pot : 76.6 VDC
or 1 Volt/turn of the fine pot

after 1 360 deg clockwise turn of the coarse pot : 71.5 VDC
or 5.1 Volts/turn of the coarse pot

after many 360 deg clockwise turns of the coarse pot : Vout min = 25.03 VDC

turn coarse pot counter clockwise so that Vout = 77.6 VDC = Vout max
after many clockwise turns of the fine pot : Vout (partial min) = 64.1 VDC

I think it's ready for the next round of testing.

2013oct25 S/N 001
2nd day of lab tests

here's some more test data:

Vin = 78.2 V (from PSU1 set point 28.4 + PSU2 set point 49.8)
78.2 V is verified with Fluke 77 DVM

the coarse and fine trim pots are adjusted so that
Vout = 77.4 V = Vout max

W/ no load the APD takes approximately 30 seconds before the Vout
to fully drop to 0V.  See fut her details below.

with a Mastech M9803R multimeter in 4 mA scale :
1) with 78.2 V directly across a 2.232e6 ohm 1% resistor.
   theory says 35 uA
   Mastech reports: 42 uA
   close enough.

2) with APD loaded by a 2.232e6 ohm resistor
   Vout = 30.43 V
   I = 16 uA

3) with APD loaded by a 1e6 ohm resistor
   Vout = 16.72 V
   I = 17 uA

4) with APD loaded by a 0 ohm direct short
   Vout = 0.002 V
   I = 19 uA

   when remove Vin it takes about 18 seconds for Iout
   to drop to 0.
   then Iout pops up to ~ 13 uA and immediately starts to
   drop down towards 0 uA.
   By 33 seconds Iout is and stays at 0 uA.


*** Note: 
1) still have not tested the stability
2) have not tested with C10 installed on the 10V ref trim pin

2014jan23  S/N 002
very quick and dirty check out
it matches S/N 001.

Same values for the Vout min and Vout max and Iout max.

Same values for the time for Vout and I out to decay to
zero after the power is shut off.

Same changes in Vout for each rotation of the fine and coarse
trim pots.

S/N 002 is approved for the next round of testing.

very quick and dirty check out
it matches S/N 001 (and S/N 002).

Same values for the Vout min and Vout max and Iout max.

Same values for the time for Vout and I out to decay to
zero after the power is shut off.

Same changes in Vout for each rotation of the fine and coarse
trim pots.

S/N 003 is approved for the next round of testing.
