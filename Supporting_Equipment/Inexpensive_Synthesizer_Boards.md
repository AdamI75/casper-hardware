# Inexpensive Synthesizer Boards

We are currently using the
[Valon 5003](http://www.valontechnology.com/eval_synthzrs.html) in the
[SETI Spectrometer](https://github.com/casper-astro/publications/blob/master/Projects/files/SETI_Spectrometer.md).

According to Valon:

The new Valon 5007 is in the same form factor as the previous 5003 and
5005 models but offers a much wider programmable frequency range of
137.5-4400MHz. Like the previous version, this is a dual output
synthesizer but unlike the previous model, there is no restriction
frequency rangeâ€¦they both cover the entire 137.5-4400MHz range.

The ability to select an external reference is now completely under user
control using the Configuration Manager software. You can select an
external reference input or the internal reference without any board
modifications. The external reference frequency is also selectable, you
can use either 10MHz like the internal reference or select an external
10MHz, 5MHz, 20MHz, 50MHz, or 100MHz source.

The phase noise is also better on the 5007 by about 8 to 10dB or more
depending on output frequency.

Valon now recommends the 5007 dual synthesizer instead of the 5003.
