## Implementation Status

Schematics were completed in 2007, and layout was finished in March
2008. The first prototype boards were fabricated and have been assembled
as of mid-April 2008. The first of the prototypes was powered-up April
25 2008 at meerKAT. During May tests have been done that have verified
basic functionality of the Virtex 5 FPGA, the Actel management FPGA, the
XAUI/10GbE connections, the DDR2 memory for the FPGA, the QDR memory,
and the ZDOK connections. The PowerPC and associated devices have also
been tested. These tests have revealed several issues whose solutions
have been incorporated into a new board revision; this revision was
completed in July 2008. Assembled boards were received on 6 August 2008
and testing was completed in November 2008.

A (tentative) first production version has been designed and is
currently being manufactured and assembled.
