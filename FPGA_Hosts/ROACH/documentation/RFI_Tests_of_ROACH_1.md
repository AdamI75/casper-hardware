Please find attached two test reports of the ROACH board anechoic
chamber RFI testing. The first of these was performed with an Istar D107
chassis open, and the second was performed with the chassis closed, and
some representative cabling, but not the CX4 cables. No RFI testing was
done with the more RFI tight "roach nest" enclosure.
